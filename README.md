# Object detection- To find the Biggest Strawberry using OpenCV

This is a simple OpenCV code to detect the biggest strawberry in the given picture and circle it.
It has been commented heavily and is almost self explanatory.
Change the path of the image in the code and try to run it and make sure the strawberries don't touch each other in the image.
